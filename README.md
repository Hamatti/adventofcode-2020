# Advent of Code 2020

Hey there! I'm trying to solve puzzles with code again this year for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I usually end up with first 3-4 days and then I kinda forget it.

Let's see how it goes this time.

I'm planning to learn a bit of Rust.

## Installing

Follow [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) installation instructions.

## Running solutions

The project is split into separate binaries within one cargo project.

You can run individual solutions with

```bash
$ cargo run --bin day01 < inputs/day01.txt
```

or run single days tests with

```bash
$ cargo test --bin day01
```

in root directory

## Solutions

⭐️ [Day 01](src/bin/day01.rs)

## Acknowledgements

I copied the project structure from [Jaakko Husso's repository](https://github.com/Cadiac/adventofcode).
